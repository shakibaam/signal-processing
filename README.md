# signal-processing
There 4 different project here that each cover a different section in the Signal Processing world; from Plotting signals to convoulotion, fourier-series, etc.

## Project List
* [Plotting signals](https://github.com/shakibaam/signal-processing/tree/master/Plotting%20signals)
* [convoulotion](https://github.com/shakibaam/signal-processing/tree/master/convoulotion)
* [fourier-series](https://github.com/shakibaam/signal-processing/tree/master/fourier-series)
* [fourier-transform](https://github.com/shakibaam/signal-processing/tree/master/fourier-transform)

## Plotting signals
Using numpy and matplotlib python libraries to plot discrete and continous signals. There are some examples depicted in the picture below:

 ![continious](https://github.com/shakibaam/signal-processing/blob/master/pictures/continous.png)

## Convolution
A function has been written to calculate the convolution of two Gaussian functions.

## Fourier Series and transforms

A function has been written to calculate the approximation of a signal from c=0 to c=10, and at each step, it plots the approximated signal. The is one example of inpute and approximated output signal in the picture below. The first picture is the input and the seconf inpute is the approximated signal.
